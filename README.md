## 📂 Repository Structure

# 🔤 Strings – DSA Practice

This folder contains my practice codes and solutions for **String-related problems** in Data Structures and Algorithms.  
The goal is to strengthen problem-solving skills and master common string manipulation techniques.

### 📁 Subfolders
- [Easy Problems](./Strings/Easy) – Covers basic string manipulations (palindrome check, anagram, substring search, etc.)  
- [Medium Problems](./Strings/Medium) – More challenging problems involving hashing, sliding window, and pattern matching.

# 🔁 Recursion – DSA Practice

This folder contains my practice codes and solutions for **Recursion problems** in Data Structures and Algorithms.  
It focuses on understanding the recursive approach, breaking down problems into smaller sub-problems, and applying recursion to solve:  
- Factorial, Fibonacci, and basic math functions  
- Backtracking problems (e.g., N-Queens, Rat in a Maze, Sudoku solver)  
- Divide & Conquer techniques  

### 📁 Subfolders
- [Easy Problems](./Recursion/Easy) – Simple recursion-based problems to build fundamentals.  
- [Medium Problems](./Recursion/Medium) – Covers backtracking and divide & conquer challenges.
